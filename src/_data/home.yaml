    about: >
      Before relocating to the north Elissa was the Acting Head of Singing at
      the Guildford School of Acting (GSA) and Audition leader for 6 years.
      Elissa is also an External Examiner for Drama Schools across the UK and
      has taught globally within the musical theatre and commercial sectors.


      Elissa continues to work as a Vocal Coach to stars throughout the West End, TV and Film including work for Disney and Fox Entertainment and as a musical theatre specialist in conservatoires across the UK.


      Having spent so much time auditioning tens of thousands of people for Drama School Elissa noted there was a real gap in training for the pre Drama School ages in the way of Musical Theatre expertise. She found students had usually been to dance schools, singing classes, acting classes or musical theatre classes but there was very little in the way of integrative training for the musical theatre artist which is why her Rotherham based school Encore Musical Theatre was born.


      Now in parternership with Jourdan, Elissa is excited to solidify this unique training process for the 16+ aged student and help those aspiring performers to achieve their dreams.

  In our Audition Preparation classes you will experience training in all
  disciplines. You will learn about yourself and how best to use your skills to
  help you stand out across the board no matter your background. You will be
  educated in ways to use your individuality to your advantage. We will help you
  to understand what the panel are really looking for in each skill and what to
  expect for the varying formats of auditions. You will learn where to invest
  your focus for your own unique development and how to manage audition nerves
  and anxiety.


  In the discipline of dance you will not only experience a mix in audition style dance calls but also benefit from the training within this context to help take your skills to the next level. We will help you improve pick up speed, style, strength and flexibility and how to make your body work for you.


  In singing you will learn how to choose the right songs for your voice, the way to use your voice to showcase yourself in the best way and how to effectively integrate acting into song. You will learn how nervous energy can affect the voice and how to use it to your advantage as well as fundamental techniques to enhance your vocal facility.


  In acting you will learn how to be present in the space, how to think on your feet and how to make sure your performance highlights your versatility as an actor. We will help you unlock your text and your voice and make the decisions important to improve authenticity and truth as the actor.
