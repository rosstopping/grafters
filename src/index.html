            <p>Before relocating to the north Elissa was the Acting Head of Singing at the Guildford School of Acting (GSA) and Audition leader for 6 years. Elissa is also an External Examiner for Drama Schools across the UK and has taught globally within the musical theatre and commercial sectors. </p>
            <p>Elissa continues to work as a Vocal Coach to stars throughout the West End, TV and Film including work for Disney and Fox Entertainment and as a musical theatre specialist in conservatoires across the UK.</p>
            <p>Having spent so much time auditioning tens of thousands of people for Drama School Elissa noted there was a real gap in training for the pre Drama School ages in the way of Musical Theatre expertise. She found students had usually been to dance schools, singing classes, acting classes or musical theatre classes but there was very little in the way of integrative training for the musical theatre artist which is why her Rotherham based school Encore Musical Theatre was born. </p>
            <p>Now in parternership with Jourdan, Elissa is excited to solidify this unique training process for the 16+ aged student and help those aspiring performers to achieve their dreams.</p>
